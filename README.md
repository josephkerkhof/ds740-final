# Overview

This project aims to predict if a flight will be departing an airport on time using data from the [US Government](https://www.kaggle.com/divyansh22/flight-delay-prediction).

You can read my [short summary](./docs/Final.md).

# Tools Used

I used two tools for this R, and Python/Tensorflow. You can run both locally, or see the section below if you want to run my Tensorflow code in a Google Collab notebook.

# Running the Tensorflow on Google Collab

Don't want to install docker, NVIDIA drivers, and run bin scripts to set up a local Jupyter notebook? I don't blame you.

Run my Tensorflow code in a [Google Collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zrpRhNVXQRnX-7WSj9xU__xQP6AVIPUg#scrollTo=GPqsXtFsawAR&forceEdit=true) instead.
