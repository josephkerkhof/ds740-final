# Running the Tensorflow on Google Collab

Don't want to install docker, NVIDIA drivers, and run bin scripts to set up a local Jupyter notebook? I don't blame you.

Run my Tensorflow code in a [Google Collab](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zrpRhNVXQRnX-7WSj9xU__xQP6AVIPUg/view?usp=sharing) instead.
